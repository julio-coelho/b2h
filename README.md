## B2H
=======

It's a NPM Command Line Interface tool to convert a base64 input file into a hexadecimal correspondent.

## Motivation

Well, I needed a good entry to JtR, and I had only base64 lists.

## Installation

    git clone
    npm install
    npm link

Nothing else...

## Tests

    $ b2h SXadG1Zq0U2O39tX13f9P2/m45o=

        or 

    $ b2h -f ~/Downloads/hashes.txt
